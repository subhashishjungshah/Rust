# Rust Programming Language Exploration

Welcome to my repository dedicated to learning and exploring the Rust programming language! This repository contains code, notes, and resources as I delve deeper into Rust's features and functionalities.

## About Rust

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a modern, systems programming language that emphasizes safety, performance, and concurrency. It provides powerful abstractions and a strong type system while ensuring memory safety without the need for a garbage collector.
